# Ising Model Simulations for Perovskites

This repository contains simulations of the Ising model applied to perovskite materials. The Ising model is a mathematical model used to study the behavior of magnetic materials, including ferroelectric materials like perovskites. The simulations explore both isotropic and anisotropic propagations to analyze the magnetic behavior of perovskite systems.


## Requirements

The simulations are implemented in Python and require the following dependencies:

- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- Jupyter Notebook

Ensure you have these packages installed before running the simulations.
